Dungeon game where the player hunts vampires

This is a project that was done through a MOOC course (Object-Oriented programming with Java, part II) by University of Helsinki. 
This specific project was the end project for week 10 ( https://materiaalit.github.io/2013-oo-programming/part2/week-10/ ).

As it is a part of the course, it is validated through TMC which runs the tests online, so my project had to be modified in some parts to accommodate the tests so that I would points for it.

This is how the project should work:

In the game, the player is in a dungeon full of vampires. The player has to destroy the vampires before his lamp runs out of battery and the vampires can suck his blood in the darkness. The player can see the vampires with a blinking of their lamp, after which they have to move blind before the following blinking. With one move, the player can walk as many steps as they want.

The game situation, i.e. the dungeon, the player and the vampires are shown in text form. The first line in the print output tells how many moves the player has left (that is to say, how much battery the lamp has). After that, the print output shows player and vampire positions, which in turn are followed by the game map.
